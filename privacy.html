        The main objective of FNShop is to respect the privacy of its users. This site explains what information could be collected when you use our website with transparency.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
        FNShop contains links to external sites. We have no control over them and they have different privacy policies from ours. We therefore recommend that you check their privacy policies.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
        FNShop collects completely non-identifiable information using a third-party service, abla.io, an alternative to Google Analytics that is privacy-respecting and respects different European regulations on the subject. This allows our site to use no cookies. The collected data is: the day of your visit, the page you visited, the country you are in, the length of your visit, and the country you are in. These data, stored by abla.io in France, allow us to better understand how our users use our site to improve us, without compromising your privacy.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
        For now, we use no cookies, third-party or not, and we do not have any advertisements on our website. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
        However, although most changes are minor, FNShop may modify its privacy policy at any time. We therefore invite you to consult it regularly.
